===============

Some examples I used when teaching jQuery basics.

If you want to use it as an exercise :
* open index.html
* go and watch level 1 page
* don't look at the js code, and try to code something similar by yourself
* when it's done, or if you are stuck, you can look at level_1.js
* don't go to level 2 until you understand every line in level_1.js (visit jQuery doc when needed)
* do the same for the following levels
